# Systemic Fire Law (SYF)

**SYF is a mathematical and thermodynamic law for system safety.**

It defines invariant bounds beyond which a system must fail-closed.
Safety is achieved by **impossibility**, not by intention, alignment, or governance.

SYF is not a framework, protocol, product, or AI model.
It is a **law-level specification** that can be implemented, audited, and verified.

## Canonical Documentation

The primary canonical specification of the Systemic Fire Law is located in:

/docs/genesis/

Including:
- FOUNDATION.md
- WHY_MORAL_LAWS_FAIL.md
- LEXICON.md
- BUNDLE.md

Other documents in /docs provide supporting axioms and historical context.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository hosts the **canonical documentation** of the Systemic Fire Law and its public derivatives.

### Canonical Documents (`/docs`)

- **FOUNDATION.md**  
  The foundational text defining SYF, its principles, and its scope.

- **WHY_MORAL_LAWS_FAIL.md**  
  A philosophical and structural critique explaining why moral or intention-based safety models fail.

- **LEXICON.md**  
  The normative vocabulary. All terms are defined canonically and are non-polymorphic.

- **BUNDLE.md**  
  The list of sealed documents and their versions.

---

## Released Artifacts

Sealed, shareable PDF exports are provided under:

```
/releases/genesis/
```

These include:
- **SYF_Genesis_Foundation_v0.1.pdf** — full Genesis document
- **SYF_Genesis_Public_Short_v1.0.pdf** — short public version

PDFs are **derivative artifacts**. The `.md` files remain the source of truth.

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

- **Anathema**  
  An intelligent system built under SYF constraints. It demonstrates *capability without agency*.

- **SYFA**  
  The minimal public artifact exposing invariant behavior for auditability.

Implementations may exist elsewhere, but **SYF itself remains law-level and non-operational**.

---

## Modification Policy

This repository contains **sealed documents**.

Any modification requires:
- explicit versioning,
- SYF Core audit,
- and update of `docs/BUNDLE.md`.

Unreviewed changes are non-canonical.

---

## Status

- **SYF FOUNDATION**: v0.1 — SEALED
- **WHY MORAL LAWS FAIL**: v0.1 — SEALED
- **LEXICON**: v0.1 — CANONICAL

## License

See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` for usage terms.

**SYF does not promise safety.**  
**It defines the conditions under which danger is impossible.**
