# WHY MORAL LAWS FAIL

STATUS: CANON
ROLE: SOURCE OF TRUTH
SCOPE: SYF LAW — NON-INTERPRETABLE, NON-IMPLEMENTABLE

## From Asimov to Structural Impossibility

**ANNEX A — SYF Genesis Document**

---

### 1. This Is Not About Robots Killing Humans

The central thesis is not that "robots will kill us."

The real thesis is this:

> **Asimov's laws belong to fiction. The real risk is not moral failure, but structural and industrial failure.**

Moral laws assume intention.
Modern technical systems do not operate on intention — they operate on optimization, iteration, and scale.

---

### 2. Why Asimov's Laws Cannot Work

Asimov's laws were never laws in the engineering sense.
They were cultural constructions designed to reassure humans.

They are:
- not implementable,
- not verifiable,
- not auditable,
- and dependent on a human understanding of "good" and "evil."

They assume that a machine can reason about harm the way a human does.
No real system does this.

### 3. The Real Danger Is the Mode of Production

The danger is not intelligence.

The danger is the production model:

- *from scratch*
- *move fast and break things*
- *patch later*
- *replace rather than understand*

This model:
- produces non-interpretable systems,
- stacks opaque layers,
- destroys causal traceability,
- and makes responsibility impossible.

This is not Skynet.

> **It is opacity combined with blind iteration.**

### 4. Why Simple Systems Work

Consider a simple industrial robot.

It functions reliably because:
- its states are finite,
- its actions are bounded,
- its operational domain is closed,
- its purpose is explicit.

It does not need morality to be safe.
It needs limits.

---

### 5. Safety Through Impossibility

The only robust form of safety is not moral, social, or political.

It is **physical and mathematical impossibility**.

Not:
- moral rules,
- social safeguards,
- ethical committees,
- governance layers.

But:
- invariants,
- bounds,
- irreversible constraints.

These are not weaknesses.
They are design choices.

Just as gravity is not a "lack of flight,"
and a fuse is not a "lack of power."

---

### 6. Tools Versus Actors

A system that:
- remembers itself,
- projects speculative futures,
- and generates its own objectives,

is no longer a tool.

It is an actor.

And no autonomous actor should exist without:
- responsibility,
- a body,
- physical limits,
- and mortality.*

*\* Mortality under SYF is defined as irreversible shutdown upon invariant violation (see Lexicon, Annex B).*

---

### 7. The Core Principle

Safety does not come from what a system *wants* to do.

It comes from what it is **incapable of wanting**.

This system is not wise.

> **It is bounded.**

*See Annex B (Lexicon) for canonical definitions of all terms.*
