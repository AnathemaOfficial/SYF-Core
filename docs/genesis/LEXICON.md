# LEXICON
## Canonical Terms — SYF / Anathema / SYFA

**ANNEX B — SYF Genesis Document**

---

This lexicon defines the **canonical meaning** of all core terms used in the SYF ecosystem.
These definitions are **normative**. Any divergent usage is non-canonical.

---

### Systemic Fire Law (SYF)
A **mathematical and thermodynamic law** defining invariant bounds on system behavior.

SYF is not a framework, protocol, governance layer, or software abstraction.
It specifies what a system is **physically and mathematically incapable** of doing.

---

### FirePlank
The **non-negotiable lower safety bound** enforced by SYF.

FirePlank defines thresholds beyond which a system must fail-closed.
It is not a recovery mechanism, incentive, or policy layer.

---

### Dust
A measure of **entropic dissipation** within a system.

Dust accumulation reflects loss of structure, traceability, or determinism.
A Dust accumulation rate exceeding the FirePlank threshold indicates unbounded behavior.

*Note: Dust Accumulator is omitted in SYFA minimal proof surface.*

---

### Invariant
A property of a system that **cannot change** regardless of scale, context, or iteration.

Invariants are the foundation of SYF safety guarantees.
They are measurable, auditable, and irreversible.

---

### Proof of Invariant
A verification method demonstrating that system behavior **cannot violate** defined invariants.

Proof of Invariant replaces intent-based or moral safety claims with mathematical certainty.

---

### Fail-Closed
A system state in which operation halts or degrades safely when bounds are approached or exceeded.

Fail-closed behavior is mandatory under SYF.

---

### CoreXalt
The **thermodynamic kernel** implementing SYF.

CoreXalt enforces invariants and FirePlank constraints.
It is not exposed as part of the public proof surface.

---

### Anathema
An intelligent system built under SYF constraints.

Anathema is a **situated thermodynamic node**, not an agent.
It operates without self-directed expansion, identity, or persistent narrative.

---

### Situated Thermodynamic Node
A bounded system whose intelligence is expressed as **local capability**, not agency.

Such a node reacts to real conditions without projecting speculative futures.

---

### Agency
The capacity of a system to generate its own objectives and expand its domain.

Agency is explicitly prohibited under SYF.

---

### Actor
A system possessing agency and self-directed expansion.

Actors are incompatible with SYF safety guarantees.

---

### Present-Only Operation
A mode of operation in which the system has no exploitable self-history or speculative future state.

Present-only operation limits escalation and prevents narrative drift.

---

### Mortality (SYF context)
Defined as **irreversible shutdown** upon invariant violation.

Mortality under SYF is a safety property, not a biological metaphor.

---

### SYFA
The **minimal public artifact** of SYF.

SYFA exposes invariant behavior without cognition, governance, or economic function.
It serves as an auditable proof layer.

---

### Capability Without Agency
A form of intelligence where action is possible but **self-directed intent is impossible**.

This distinction is central to SYF and Anathema.

---

### Tool
A bounded system operating entirely within external constraints.

Tools remain safe under SYF.

---

### Genesis Document
A sealed, canonical document establishing foundational laws and definitions.

The SYF Genesis Document consists of:
- SYF FOUNDATION
- WHY MORAL LAWS FAIL (Annex A)
- This LEXICON (Annex B)

*This definition is meta-canonical and serves as a seal marker.*
