# SYF GENESIS BUNDLE
## Canonical Sealing Manifest

---

This document defines the **sealed canonical bundle** of the
**Systemic Fire Law (SYF)**.

It establishes which documents constitute the Genesis layer,
their versions, and their integrity guarantees.

## Canonical Documents

The SYF Genesis Bundle v0.2 consists of the following documents:

### Foundation Layer
- **FOUNDATION.md**  
  Status: CANONICAL — SEALED  
  Role: Foundational law defining SYF, Anathema, and SYFA

### Annex A — Philosophical Layer
- **WHY_MORAL_LAWS_FAIL.md**  
  Status: CANONICAL — SEALED  
  Role: Structural critique of moral and intention-based safety models

### Annex B — Lexical Layer
- **LEXICON.md**  
  Status: CANONICAL — SEALED  
  Role: Normative vocabulary for all canonical terms

These three documents form a single, inseparable canonical unit
referred to as the **SYF Genesis Document**.
