# FirePlank — Systemic Safety Floor

**Layer**: SYF Core  
**Status**: Canonical · v0.1-docs

## 1. Definition

FirePlank is a **mathematical continuity constraint** that ensures R never falls below a defined minimum, preserving minimal systemic coherence even under total noise.

## 2. Core Properties

- **Not a reserve** — no value is stored or controlled
- **Not a recovery mechanism** — no state is restored
- **Not bypassable** — cannot be disabled or tuned
- **No beneficiary** — introduces no reward, issuance, or inflation
- **No external trigger** — operates purely from internal state

## 3. Function

FirePlank guarantees that:

- Total system collapse is structurally impossible
- Minimum coherence is preserved regardless of input chaos
- No external intervention is required or possible

## 4. What FirePlank Is NOT

- Not a reset mechanism
- Not a failsafe with human override
- Not a financial safety net
- Not auditable via external logs
- Not a recovery path

> FirePlank is a **thermodynamic floor**, not a policy.

## 5. Invariance

FirePlank behavior cannot be:

- Externally triggered
- Externally suppressed
- Modified at runtime
- Negotiated or overridden

If FirePlank can be bypassed, the implementation is invalid.
